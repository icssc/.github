# ICS Student Council at UC Irvine

ICS Student Council was founded by students to better serve the ICS student body.
We work to improve the lives of the students professionally, socially, and academically and deepen the connections students have with the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences and UCI Alumni.
